slp is a framework for fast and reproducible development of multimodal models, with emphasis on
NLP models.

It started as a collection of scripts and code I wrote / collected during my PhD and it evolves
accordingly.

As such, the framework is opinionated, meaning it follows a convention over configuration approach.
The goal is to make common patterns fast, while still remaining extendable for more complex use-cases.

This is currently in alpha release under active development, so things may break and new features
will be added.
