# SLP utility functions

Reuseable utility functions I have aggregated over the years.

**Note**: `slp.util.debug` monkey-patches python 3.7+ `breakpoint` call to use ipdb instead of pdb (if ipdb is available). This works well in my experience, but it should be transparent. This is the only under the hood operation in this project.

::: slp.util.debug
::: slp.util.log
::: slp.util.pytorch
::: slp.util.system
::: slp.util.types
